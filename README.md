## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

By the end of this Project, I learn about how to build Interactive components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learn about how to use CSS variables and how to use them in different ways. I also learn about how to use Flexbox and Grid in a better way. I also learn about how to use JavaScript to make the component interactive.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on this project to make it more interactive and responsive. I will also work on the JavaScript part to make it more interactive and user-friendly. I will also work on the design part to make it more attractive and user-friendly.
